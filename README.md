# Minecraft: PE's JSON's unofficial docs
This repository's content is composed of docs and scripts used to generate some parts of the docs.

External contribution to this repository is strongly encouraged, since so far only two people (me and @MCMrARM) worked on it and it still lacks tons of resources.

#### Please notice:
All the code in this repository will slowly be merged into the Wiki and a web version will soon be available in the `gh-pages` branch.
